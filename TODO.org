* Try Other things

  - [ ] maybe try to use ivy+counsel?
  - [X] autoload perspective file when emacs is up
    Actually I felt *autosave* is annoying every time I open up Emacs and
    do nothing then save (just see whether something works). It will break
    the previous working perspective.
  - [ ] I can bind some handy keys onto mini-buffer-map
