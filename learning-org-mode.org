* Markups

** Basic

- * for *bold*
- = for =verbatim=
- / for /italic/
- + for +strikethrough+
- _ for _underline_
- ~ for ~code~

** Syntax

Detailed syntax is here:
: PRE MARKER CONTENTS MARKER POST

- PRE: whitespace, -, (, {, ', ", or beginning of line
- MARKER: those special characters in [[Basic]] section
- CONTENTS: goes with this format =BORDER BODY BORDER=
  - BORDER: non-whitespace character
  - BODY: any character, but not more than 3 lines <-- cannot figure out, maybe a very long line?
  - BORDER and BODY: are separated by whitespaces (also cannot figure this out, maybe cannot have whitespace at the beginning of first BORDER? at the end of last BORDER?)

So the following snippets are valid:

#+begin_example
/line 1/
    /line  2/
    (/line 3/)
    -/line 4/
    -/---line 5---/-
    -*first*-/second/-+third+
#+end_example

Therefore, you *CANNOT* mark like these:

#+begin_example
    cannot-markup/word/in-line
    / some whitespace between /
    / -text-/
    /-text- /
#+end_example

Other details can be found at [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html#Emphasis_Markers][here]].

** Combine

Sometimes you can combine _/any number/_ of markups, but it seems that the results really depend on the ability of display target. And it seems that /_order_/ also matters (note underline doesn't work here).

** Special Symbols

Use =org-entities-help= can show you all the special characters (latin words, something like that).

** Literal Examples

You can use the following format to show some literal text:

: #+begin_example
: Put some text here.
: #+end_example

Another cool thing is that we can create an anchor by using =ref= keyword:

: #+begin_example -r
: I'll be referenced by the next line. (ref:lit-ref-ex)
: #+end_example

Then we can reference it like this:
: [[(lit-ref-ex)]]
or this:
: [[(lit-ref-ex)][Literal Ref Example]]

See the following example as a demo:

#+begin_example -r
head back to me (ref:back-to-me)
#+end_example

And here is the [[(back-to-me)][link/jump/portal]]

* Code Blocks

** How to Specify Execution Results Format

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Results-of-Evaluation.html][Results of Evaluation]]

** Babel Library

[[https://orgmode.org/worg/library-of-babel.html][The Library of Babel]]

** Languages

*** Python

[[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-python.html][ob-doc-python]]

** How to Load Language Library Dynamically

Type command =M-x load-library= and then keyin the language library you want, such as:

- ob-R
- ob-ruby

** Setting Parameters

You can have several ways to set parameters for code blocks.

The 1st one is to set them inline with block header:

: #+begin_src python :dir /var
: from os import listdir
: return listdir('.')
: #+end_src

and this is another way for readability when you have too many parameters:

: #+header: :dir /ssh:te1:/etc
: #+header: :var USER='super'
: #+begin_src shell
: grep "$USER" passwd
: #+end_src

The 2nd way to do this is add them with heading:

: * A Heading
:   :PROPERTIES:
:   :header-args: :dir /ssh:te2:/etc
:   :header-args:python: :dir /ssh:te2:/
:   :END:

* Links

** Internal Links

[[https://orgmode.org/manual/Internal-Links.html][Internal Links]]

Call =org-store-link= can copy the heading address for later use, call =org-insert-link= (=C-c C-l=) to insert that link.

* Properties

** What is a Property in Org-Mode?

A Property is used as a configuration appling to whole buffer.

*** Property Types

1. Buffer-wide (need to be placed at the top of buffer)

   #+begin_example
   #+PROPERTY: title Org Learning Path
   #+PROPERTY: name  Neil
   #+PROPERTY: name+ Lin  <-- append to previous /name/
   #+end_example

2. Property Drawer (placed below headlines)

   #+begin_example
   * A Header
   :PROPERTIES:
   :name:     Neil Lin
   :END:
   #+end_example

** Session Shared by Multiple Source Code Blocks

It seems that system-wide header arguments don't work on *session* arguments:

#+begin_example
    * A Header
    :PROPERTIES:
    :header-args:shell: :session *u14*
    :END:
#+end_example

Maybe the only way to set system-wide ones is by customizing the =org-babel-default-header-args= variable.

The [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Using-Header-Arguments.html][official manual]] says we can set =header-args= with specified language, so that given session can be shared between different code blocks. Like this:

#+begin_example
    * A Header
    :PROPERTIES:
    :header-args:shell: :session *session-name*
    :END:

    #+begin_src shell
    ssh ubuntu-14
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src shell
    hostname -I
    #+end_src
#+end_example

** In-Buffer Option

In org-mode, you can change its behavior by setting variables named as =org-SOME-VAR=. But sometimes you don't want to enable them for all org buffers, you just want to tweak them in some indivisual buffers. So you may search on the internet by using keyword *in-buffer option*.

* Todos

** Track Progress

Adding =[/]= or =[%]= anywhere in the headline to track its progress. See: [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Breaking-Down-Tasks.html#Breaking-Down-Tasks][Breaking Down Tasks into Subtasks]]

Example:

#+begin_example
    * A Header [1/4]
        - [ ] Milk
        - [X] Ham
        - [ ] Butter
        - [-] Veges [33%]
            - [ ] Lettuce
            - [X] Mushroom
            - [ ] Cucumber
#+end_example

Tip: use ~C-c C-c~ to update TODO status

** Checkboxes

A lightweight version of TODO, often used to split simple tasks.

Tip: use ~S-M-RET~ to insert a new checkbox (org-insert-todo-heading)

* PDF

I was trying to install =pdflatex= on Mac:

#+begin_src shell :results silent
brew install --cask mactex-no-gui
#+end_src

But brew kept on getting failures when downloading ghostscript fonts:

#+begin_example
==> Downloading https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gs-fonts/gs-fonts/8.11%20%28base%2035%2C%20GPL%29/ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11.tar.gz
######################################################################## 100.0%
curl: (7) Failed to connect to nchc.dl.sourceforge.net port 443: Operation timed out
  Error: Failed to download resource "ghostscript--fonts"
Download failed: https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/gs-fonts/gs-fonts/8.11%20%28base%2035%2C%20GPL%29/ghostscript-fonts-std-8.11.tar.gz
#+end_example

Maybe try another day :(

Updated: I tried again on [2021-02-24 Wed] and it successed!

Then, restart the terminal (or vterm, in my case).

Used the following command to check the binary path:

#+begin_src shell
which pdflatex
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /Library/TeX/texbin/pdflatex

[2021-02-24 Wed] Updated: although PDF function is working now, but the output file seemed not so pretty. Maybe there's another better way to export as PDF.

* Drawers

** Log Notes into Drawers

To create a logbook, type =C-c C-z=. But this feature need to be configured first by setting =org-log-into-drawer= a proper value:
- =nil=: insert note after the headline
- =t=: /LOGBOOK/ (default drawer name)
- other string: rename drawer

* Refiling and Archiving

** Commands

- =C-c C-w= (=org-refile=): move headings and their contents to another heading
- =C-u C-u C-c C-w= (=org-refile-goto-last-stored=): jump to the heading where the last =org-refile= target to
- =C-c M-w= (=org-refile-copy=): like =org-refile= but don't delete the original content
- =C-c $= (=org-archive-subtree=): move headings into a pre-defined file

** Details

*** Refiling

When choosing a target, only the level 1 headlines in the current buffer are considered. If you want to change this behavior, see =org-refile-targets=.

[2021-03-12 Fri] Stumbled a [[https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2017/03/19/organizing-notes-with-refile.html][page]] talking about how to list targets in a better way, which we can intuitively see the structure of different level headings.

*** Archiving

If you want to archive headings into another file, check =org-archive-location= variable or in-buffer option =ARCHIVE=, like this:

: #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::

* Org-Roam

** How Other People Use Org-Roam

** Setup Org-protocol

Used the following command to install =EmacsClient.app= on MacOS:

#+begin_src shell
brew install emacsclient --cask
#+end_src

And then I could test its functionality from shell (see /init.el/ for Emacs settings):

#+begin_src shell
emacsclient -n "org-protocol:///capture?url=http%3a%2f%2fduckduckgo%2ecom&title=DuckDuckGo"
#+end_src

On Firefox, opened up a blank tab and enter ~about:config~ to enter advanced settings page, and set ~network.protocol-handler.external.org-protocol~ to ~true~.

But ran into a problem that although Firefox seemed like to call =EmacsClient.app= but there's nothing on corresponding org file. After googled it around 2+ weeks, I still didn't get any progress.

Then, on <2021-04-13 Tue> an idea poped on my head. Because both =emacsclient= (bundled with Emacs) and =EmacsClient= are pointed to the same path:

#+begin_src shell :results output
ls -l $(which emacsclient)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: lrwxr-xr-x  1 lab  wheel  54 11 24 14:14 /usr/local/bin/emacsclient -> /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient

#+begin_src shell :results output
ls -l $(which EmacsClient)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: lrwxr-xr-x  1 lab  wheel  54 11 24 14:14 /usr/local/bin/EmacsClient -> /Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/emacsclient

Maybe the one, =emacsclient= could not work with Firefox. So I jumped into =/Applications/EmacsClient.app/Contents/MacOS= and backup =applet= first:

#+begin_src shell :results output
cd /Applications/EmacsClient.app/Contents/MacOS

if [ ! -e applet.bak ]; then
    cp -p applet applet.bak
fi
#+end_src

And then used =Finder= to open and edit =/Applications/EmacsClient= with script editor like this:

[[~/Dropbox/mywiki/images/Fix wrong path in EmacsClient.png][Fix wrong path in EmacsClient.app]]

Then, everything worked!

I came out two version of bookmark, one is just to capture URL and title information, the other do the same thing but add selected text into capture buffer.

1. org-capture
: javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture?template=c&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)
2. org-quote
: javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture?template=q&url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'&body='+encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())
